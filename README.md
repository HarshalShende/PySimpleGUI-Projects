# PySimpleGUI-Projects
Some projects with PySimpleGUI - All files here are all open source.

1. Document String for Python Library.pyw <br>
   Import .py file or directory from Python package, and build tree list for each class and each function with document string.
   It help us to find what arguments to use in class or function quickly.
   If document string exists, there will be also document string shown for each class and each function.

2. File Manager<br>
   We always get trouble to find where my files when files get more and more.
   Here, this script manage your files by tags and you can find your files in couple seconds.
   Sorry, it is complex Chinese.
   
   Two areas shown in screen, one for tag new/edit/delete/selection and another one for file import/search/open.
   Functions on left side:
     - New Tag / 新建標籤
     - Select Root Tag / 選主標籤
     - Delete Tag / 刪除標籤
     - Rename Tag / 標籤改名
     - Search Tag / 搜索標籤
     - Next Tag / 找下一個
     - Sort Tag / 標籤排序
     - Tag MoveUp / 標籤上移
     - Tag MoveDown / 標籤下移
     - Double Click for Selection / 標籤選擇
   Functions on right side:
     - Import Files / 檔案移入
     - Selection Tag remove
    
   Here's one thing very important !!!
     - ** All files imported will be moved to a new directory D:/ALL and stored as their extension file name in seperate subdirectories.**
