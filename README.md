# PySimpleGUI-Projects
Some projects with PySimpleGUI - All files here are all open source.

1. Document String for Python Library.pyw <br>
   Import .py file or directory from Python package, and build tree list for each class and each function with document string.
   It help us to find what arguments to use in class or function quickly.
   If document string exists, there will be also document string shown for each class and each function.

   Files processing:
     - Sorry, no file processing support now. You may copy files by yourself and don't delete files after you import them. edit is OK.
     
   Here's one thing very important !!!
     - ** All files imported will be moved to a new directory D:/ALL and stored as their extension file name in seperate subdirectories.**
