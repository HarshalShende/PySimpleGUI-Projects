# PySimpleGUI-Projects
Some projects with PySimpleGUI - All files here are all open source.

## Some scripts maybe use this Tool.py
[Tool.py](https://github.com/jason990420/jason990420-outlook.com/blob/master/Tool.py)


## 1. Document String for Python Library.pyw <br>
   Import .py file or directory from Python package, and build tree list for each class and each function with document string.
   It help us to find what arguments to use in class or function quickly.
   If document string exists, there will be also document string shown for each class and each function.
   
   Right button of mouse to rename, delete or move tag when mouse on tag.

## 2. File Manager<br>
   We always get trouble to find where my files when files get more and more.
   Here, this script manage your files by tags and you can find your files in couple seconds.

   - MoveDown Tag
   
   Functions on right side:
   
   - Import Files
   - Remove Selection
    
   Serach Files:
   - Double Click tags on left side for Selection
   - Use 'Search Tag' to find tag quickly
   
   Open File:

   Files processing:
   - Sorry, no file processing support now. You may copy files by yourself and don't delete files after you import them. edit is OK.
     
   Here's one thing very important !!!
   - ** All files imported will be moved to a new directory D:/ALL and stored as their extension file name in seperate subdirectories.**
